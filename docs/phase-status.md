# Phase Status

## Phase 1 - Project Scaffold, Docs, And Route Skeleton

Status: complete

### Acceptance Criteria

- Required routes: complete
- Uploaded logo: present at `public/brand/tournament-logo.png`
- Documentation files: complete
- `AGENTS.md`: present
- Lint: passed with `npm run lint`
- Typecheck: passed with `npm run typecheck`
- Unit tests: passed with `npm run test`
- Production build: passed with `npm run build`
- E2E: not available in Phase 1 because Playwright is not introduced yet

### Changed Files

- App scaffold: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, Next, TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, PostCSS, Vitest, and Prettier config files
- Routes: `/stage`, `/room`, `/vote`, `/charts`, `/results`, `/coolguy69`
- Shared components: `TournamentLogo`, `ChartCard`, `ChartSetPanel`, `RoundHeader`, `CountdownTimer`, `QRPanel`, `AdminLayout`, `DangerousActionDialog`, `HostLockBadge`
- Shared constants and tests: `src/lib/tournament.ts`, `src/lib/tournament.test.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`
- Docs: `docs/implementation-plan.md`, `docs/data-model.md`, `docs/admin-runbook.md`, `docs/phase-status.md`, plus README/testing/runbook updates
- Ignore rules: `.gitignore` now covers Next output, generated TypeScript build info, local env files, Vercel, Supabase runtime files, logs, caches, and test output

### Manual Review

- Product rules: required routes exist, locked round set map is represented, the player label text is exact, the room offers voting and view-only choices, and no tournament decisions are made in browser code.
- Security: no secret values were added; only `.env.example` contains secret variable names; admin auth and dangerous actions remain non-operational placeholders until their planned phases.
- Data: Phase 1 has only typed constants and placeholder charts; database schema and chart import are deferred to Phases 2 and 3.
- UI: the shell uses the uploaded logo, black industrial panels, orange/red glow, rune-style accents, and readable placeholder screens without official DOOM assets.
- Tests: placeholder unit tests cover the locked route list and round set map.

### Risks And Assumptions

- Admin authentication, host lock, roster management, draw logic, voting logic, results, and CSV export are not implemented yet by design.
- E2E tests are not available yet; they should be added when Playwright is introduced in a later phase.
- The production build detected a local `.env.local`, but `.gitignore` excludes it and no local secret value was read or committed.
- npm audit for production dependencies passed after forcing patched PostCSS via npm overrides.
