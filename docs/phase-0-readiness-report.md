## Phase 0 Checks Run

- `rtk git status --short --branch`
- `rtk git diff --cached --name-only`
- `rtk git --version`
- `rtk node --version`
- `rtk npm --version`
- `rtk powershell ... supabase --version`
- `rtk powershell ... vercel --version`
- `rtk powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/write-data-audit.ps1`
- `rtk powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/write-asset-audit.ps1`
- `rtk rg -n "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=" .`
- `rtk rg -n "SESSION_SECRET=" .`
- `rtk rg -n "ADMIN_PASSWORD=" .`
- `rtk rg -n "eyJ" .`

## Blockers

- None.

## Warnings

- The source tournament logo is large. Create optimized renditions during Phase 1 or Phase 3.
- The CSV has a small number of malformed-looking rows documented in `docs/data-audit.md`; Phase 3 ingestion should handle them explicitly.
- Supabase CLI is not installed globally, but it works through `npx supabase`.
- App commands do not exist yet because Phase 1 has not scaffolded the app.

## Recommended Next Action

Commit Phase 0, then begin Phase 1 from `docs/codex-execution-plan.md`.
