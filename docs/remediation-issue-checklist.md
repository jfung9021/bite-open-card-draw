| [x]  | RIC-001 | `/stage` auto-updates after admin draw actions without manual refresh.                            | Phase 1: `tests/e2e/full-flow.spec.ts` keeps a `/stage` tab open while admin draws Set 1 and expects the stage to show `Version 1 / ...` without navigation; `rtk npm run test:e2e` passes.                                |
| [x]  | RIC-002 | `/stage` auto-updates after admin reroll actions without manual refresh.                          | Phase 1: e2e submits a per-chart reroll from admin and the already-open `/stage` tab updates to `Version 2 / ...`; `rtk npm run test:e2e` passes.                                                                          |
| [x]  | RIC-003 | `/stage` auto-updates after admin reset, voting, and reveal actions without manual refresh.       | Phase 1: `StageAutoRefresh` polls committed state; e2e verifies the already-open stage updates when voting opens and when final reveal is committed. Reset/rehearsal actions already call `revalidateTournamentViews`.     |
| [x]  | RIC-004 | Stage uses a polling, SSE, Supabase Realtime, or equivalent client refresh mechanism.             | Phase 1: `src/app/stage/StageAutoRefresh.tsx` calls `router.refresh()` every 2000ms.                                                                                                                                       |
| [x]  | RIC-005 | Draw and reroll actions revalidate all affected tournament views, not only `/coolguy69`.          | Phase 1: `drawRoundSetAction`, `rerollOneChartAction`, `rerollRoundSetAction`, and `rerollFullRoundAction` call `revalidateTournamentViews`, which revalidates `/coolguy69`, `/stage`, `/vote`, `/charts`, and `/results`. |
| [x]  | RIC-006 | Stage chart reveal is a slow automatic sequence driven by committed server/admin state.           | Phase 1: `buildStageRoundView` schedules reveal starts from draw `createdAt`; `StageSetPanel` reveals cards at 1800ms intervals from that committed timestamp.                                                             |
| [x]  | RIC-007 | Stage animation is not merely a short CSS animation on initial page render.                       | Phase 1: removed `.stage-card-reveal` and the `stage-card-rise` keyframes; cards appear according to committed draw timestamps and client time.                                                                            |
| [x]  | RIC-008 | Stage timer/status cannot go stale during pause, resume, extension, close, or reveal transitions. | Phase 1: `/stage` polls every 2000ms and e2e verifies live updates for voting-open and final-reveal transitions; timer/status snapshots are refreshed from server state.                                                   |
| [x]  | RIC-009 | Stage preview uses exactly two horizontal rows of 7 charts.                                       | Phase 1: `StageSetPanel` renders one `grid-cols-7` row per chart set, and `/stage` stacks the two set panels.                                                                                                              |
| [x]  | RIC-010 | Stage top row is Set 1 and bottom row is Set 2.                                                   | Phase 1: `buildStageRoundView` preserves `ROUND_SET_DEFINITIONS` set order; `/stage` maps Set 1 before Set 2.                                                                                                              |
| [x]  | RIC-011 | Stage row labels clearly show round and chart set labels.                                         | Phase 1: row headings render `Round X - S16/S17/...` plus `Set N / 7 charts`.                                                                                                                                              |
| [x]  | RIC-012 | Stage no longer uses 4+3 per-set panels for the projector preview.                                | Phase 1: removed the `firstRow`/`secondRow` 4+3 split from `StageSetPanel`; projector rows are always 7 columns.                                                                                                           |
| [x]  | RIC-013 | Stage reveal order is all 7 charts from Set 1, then all 7 charts from Set 2.                      | Phase 1: `stage-view.test.ts` verifies Set 2 reveal starts after `7 * STAGE_CHART_REVEAL_INTERVAL_MS + STAGE_SET_REVEAL_GAP_MS`.                                                                                           |
| [x]  | RIC-014 | Final stage reveal still shows exactly the two selected charts together.                          | Phase 1: unchanged final stage path still maps the two result sets; e2e verifies `/stage` reaches `ROUND 1 FINAL CHARTS`.                                                                                                  |
| [ ]  | RIC-015 | Tiebreak winner is hidden until the 5-second rune wheel reveal completes.                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [ ]  | RIC-016 | Tiebreak wheel still reveals a backend-decided winner and never decides the result in-browser.    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Chart Images And Data Pipeline

| [x]  | RIC-017 | Runtime draw data includes `localImagePath` for cached chart artwork.                                                              | Phase 1: `DrawStateStore` now loads through `loadRuntimeCharts`, and draw summaries carry `localImagePath` from image-enriched chart data.                                                                                        |
| [x]  | RIC-018 | Runtime draws no longer load only raw `data/source/charts.csv` rows with `localImagePath: null`.                                   | Phase 1: runtime prefers `data/generated/charts-with-images.json`; CSV is only the fallback source when the generated artifact is missing.                                                                                        |
| [x]  | RIC-019 | Runtime consumes `data/generated/charts-with-images.json`, Supabase image asset rows, or another controlled image metadata source. | Phase 1: `src/lib/charts/runtime-catalog.ts` reads `data/generated/charts-with-images.json` when present.                                                                                                                         |
| [ ]  | RIC-020 | Real cached chart image files exist in the deployed asset location or controlled storage.                                          | Phase 1 attempted `rtk npm run cache:chart-images`; it completed with `0 cached, 639 using fallback`, and `public/chart-images/cache` contained 0 files afterward. Remains open.                                                  |
| [ ]  | RIC-021 | `public/chart-images/cache` or the chosen controlled image storage is populated before event use.                                  | Phase 1 verification measured 0 files in `public/chart-images/cache`; remains open for event setup.                                                                                                                               |
| [ ]  | RIC-022 | `cache:chart-images` can produce non-fallback cached assets in normal event setup.                                                 | Phase 1 run exited 0 but all upstream fetches failed with generated `failureReason: "fetch failed"`; remains open until a network/source fix produces cached assets.                                                              |
| [x]  | RIC-023 | Fallback artwork is used only for missing or failed cached images.                                                                 | Phase 1: `resolveRuntimeChartImages` keeps non-fallback local paths only if the public asset exists; `image-cache.test.ts` and `runtime-catalog.test.ts` cover cached vs fallback behavior.                                       |
| [x]  | RIC-024 | Stage chart cards render cached chart artwork when available.                                                                      | Phase 1: `StageDrawCard` uses `chart.localImagePath ?? FALLBACK_CHART_IMAGE_PATH`; runtime catalog tests verify cached local paths are preserved when files exist.                                                                |
| [x]  | RIC-025 | Vote/player chart cards render chart artwork where chart art is required.                                                          | Phase 1: `BallotFlow` uses chart local image paths as card backgrounds while preserving the phone two-column layout.                                                                                                              |
| [x]  | RIC-026 | View-only chart surfaces render chart artwork where chart art is required.                                                         | Phase 1: `/charts` uses `StageSetPanel`/`StageDrawCard`, and result panels use `row.chart.localImagePath` with fallback.                                                                                                          |
| [x]  | RIC-027 | Image cache status, original `bg_img`, local image path, and failure reason are persisted or reproducible.                         | Phase 1: `rtk npm run cache:chart-images` regenerated `data/generated/image-assets.json` and `charts-with-images.json` with `remoteUrl`, `localPath`, `status`, and `failureReason`; generated files remain ignored/reproducible. |
| [ ]  | RIC-028 | Image rendering is verified with automated natural-width or screenshot checks.                                                     | Phase 1 added unit/e2e coverage for image path selection and stage updates, but no natural-width or screenshot image-render assertion yet.                                                                                        |

## Final Closure Gate

The remediation plan is complete only when:

- Every checklist item above is checked.
- `npm run lint` passes.
- `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm run test` passes.
- `npm run build` passes.
- `npm run test:e2e` passes or any excluded e2e coverage is explicitly documented with a replacement manual rehearsal check.
- Chart import and image cache setup have been run and verified with non-fallback chart artwork.
- A full four-round rehearsal has been completed with persistent state.
- Risks and assumptions are documented in `docs/phase-status.md`.
